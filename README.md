# A simple ATM machine cli program that has the following features:

```markdown
Change Pin (you can create a default pin in your code and then change it in the function)
Account balance
Withdraw funds
Deposit funds
Cancel/Exit (selecting this option should exit the program)
```


The flow of the program is as follows
Run the cli program - 
```markdown
go run main.go
``` 


A prompt asking you to enter your default pin is displayed,
once the entered pin is successful, 
you are asked to change pin immediately.
once that is successful
display menu options for the operations that can be carried out in the cli program.
When a user completes an operation, the program asks them if they want to perform another operation before finally exiting.
